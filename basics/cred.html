    <h5>Cash</h5>
    <p>Cash is an abstract measure of a PC's liquid assets.</p>
    <p>The few bits PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If a character wants to spend to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC’s lifestyle quality for a fortune roll.</p>

    <h5>Monetary values</h5>
    <ul>
     <li>1 cash: A week’s wages.</li>
     <li>2 cash: A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.</li>
     <li>4 cash: A month’s wages.</li>
     <li>6 cash: An exquisite jewel.</li>
     <li>8 cash: A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of cred chips and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.</li>
     <li>10 cash: Liquidating a significant asset—a nice car, a deed to a small business.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>More than 4 cash is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it into your cred (see below). A crew can also store 4 cash in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a vault, they can expand their stores to 8 and then 16 cash. Any cash beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next mission) or distributed among the crew members.</p>

    <h5>Cash Use</h5>
    <ul>
     <li>Spend 1 cash to get an additional activity during downtime.</li>
     <li>Spend 1 cash to change a downtime activity roll from a 7-9 to a 10+ after rolling.</li>
     <li>Spend cash to avoid certain crew entanglements.</li>
     <li>Put cash into your character’s cred to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire. See the next section.</li>
     <li>Spend cash to advance your crew’s Tier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Cred and Retirement</h5>
    <p>When you mark your character’s final trauma and they retire, or you take retirement as an advance, the amount of cash they’ve managed to turn into cred determines their fate. Your cred tracker is on your character sheet.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Cred 0-10: Poor soul. You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.</li>
     <li>Cred 11-20: Meager. A tiny apartment that you can call your own.</li>
     <li>Cred 21-39: Modest. A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a small business.</li>
     <li>Cred 40: Fine. A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, each full row of cred (10 cash) indicates the quality level of the character’s lifestyle, from zero (street life) to four (luxury).</p>

    <h5>Turning Cred into Cash</h5>
    <p>If you want to liquidate some of your cred, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. For every 2 cred removed, you get 1 cash.</p>
