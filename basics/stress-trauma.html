    <h5>Stress</h5>
    <p>Player characters in Terminal Glow have a special reserve called stress. When they suffer a consequence that they don’t want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of their attempt to <i>resist</i> determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.</p>

    <h5>Pushing Yourself</h5>
    <p>You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. Whenever you make a move, before you roll, you may choose each bonus listed below once. For each bonus you choose, take 2 stress:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Add a +1 bonus to your roll. This bonus may be chosen for any move where extra effort would help you.</li>
     <li>Take action when you’re incapacitated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Trauma</h5>
    <p>When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of trauma. When you take trauma, circle one of your trauma conditions like Cold, Reckless, Unstable, etc. They’re all described below.</p>
    <p>When you suffer trauma, you’re taken out of action. You’re "left for dead" or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, you have zero stress and you've gotten your fix for the next downtime.</p>

    <p>Trauma conditions are permanent. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. When you mark your fourth trauma condition, your character cannot continue as a daring scoundrel. You must retire them to a different life or send them to prison to take the fall for the crew’s wanted level.</p>

    <h5>Trauma Conditions</h5>
    <ul>
     <li>Cold: You’re not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.</li>
     <li>Haunted: You’re often lost in reverie, reliving terrible memories of the past.</li>
     <li>Obsessed: You’re enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.</li>
     <li>Paranoid: You imagine danger everywhere; you can’t trust others.</li>
     <li>Reckless: You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.</li>
     <li>Soft: You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle.</li>
     <li>Unstable: Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage, or fall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.</li>
     <li>Vicious: You seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.</li>
    </ul>
