    <h5>PC Advancement</h5>
    <p>Each player keeps track of the experience points (xp) that their character earns.</p>
    <p>During the game session, mark xp:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you roll a 6 or less on any move, +1xp</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you complete a mission, succeed or fail, mark +3xp and:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>If you completed your directive, +1xp. Directives are detailed in a later section.</li>
     <li>If you otherwise expressed your beliefs, drives, or background, +1xp. Your character’s beliefs and drives are yours to define, session to session. Feel free to tell the group about them when you mark xp.</li>
     <li>If you struggled with issues from your fix or traumas, +1xp. Mark xp for this if your vice tempted you to some bad action or if a trauma condition caused you trouble. Simply indulging your vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you overindulge).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you fill your xp track, clear all the marks and take an advance. Basic advances can be chosen at any time, specialized advances can only be chosen after taking any 5 basic advances. Unless otherwise noted, each advance can only be chosen once.</p>
    <p><b>Basic Advances:</b></p>
    <ul>
     <li>Choose another move from your playbook (Repeatable, no max)</li>
     <li>Choose another move from another playbook (Repeatable, 3 max)</li>
     <li>+1 Style (Up to +2)</li>
     <li>+1 Edge (Up to +2)</li>
     <li>+1 Cool (Up to +2)</li>
     <li>+1 Mind (Up to +2)</li>
     <li>+1 Meat (Up to +2)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Specialized Advances:</b></p>
    <ul>
     <li>+1 to any one attribute (Up to +3)</li>
     <li>Buy off owned or hunted (Repeatable, no max)</li>
     <li>Change your character to a new playbook (Keeping attributes and all 'intrinsic' moves)</li>
     <li>Retire your character to safety (Without having to mark a fourth trauma)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your crew takes the mastery upgrade, all members of the crew also gain the following specialized advance:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>+1 to any one attribute (Repeatable, Up to +2)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also earn xp by training during downtime. When you train, mark +1xp. You may only train once per downtime phase.</p>

    <h5>Crew Advancement</h5>
    <p>When you complete a mission, succeed or fail, mark xp:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>If you completed your crew's directive, +1xp. Directives are detailed in a later section.</li>
     <li>If you contended with challenges above your current station, like higher-tiered factions or dangerous opposition, +1xp.
     <li>If you bolstered your crew’s reputation or developed a new one, +1xp. Review your crew’s reputation. Did you do anything to promote it?</li>
     <li>Express the goals, drives, inner conflict, or essential nature of the crew, +1xp. This one is very broad! Essentially, did anything happen that highlighted the specific elements that make your crew unique?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you fill your crew advancement tracker, clear the marks and take a new crew advance or mark two crew upgrade boxes. Say how you’ve obtained this new advance or upgrades for the crew. Where did it come from? How does it become a new part of the crew?</p>
    <p><b>Profits</b></p>
    <p>Every time the crew advances, each PC gets cred equal to the crew Tier+2, to represent profits generated by the crew as they’ve been operating.</p>

    <h5>Directives</h5>
    <p>Directives are the motivations, problems, connections, duties, and loyalties that throw you curve balls, pull your focus off the task at hand, and generally complicate your shadowy, illegal career.</p>
    <p>There are two kinds of directives: personal and crew. Crew directives are determined by your crew's playbook, and usually have to do with the essence of what makes your crew work. Personal directives are chosen or designed at character creation, and represent your character's life beyond the mission. Some example personal directives are as follows, but you are also welcome to come up with your own:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Behavioral - Describe your ethical code. Place your ethical code above the mission.</li>
     <li>Compassionate - Place your compassion to the powerless above the mission.</li>
     <li>Deceptive - Place your devotion to lies about your identity or past above the mission.</li>
     <li>Filial - Listen to the advice of a trusted NPC over one of your teammates.</li>
     <li>Financial - Place your desire for profit above the mission.</li>
     <li>Hierarchic - Improve your standing or impair a rival's standing among a group you are a member of.</li>
     <li>Proselytizing - Persuade others to act according to your belief system.</li>
     <li>Illustrious - Place your desire for fam above the mission.</li>
     <li>Intimate - Place a close personal relationship above the mission.</li>
     <li>Masochistic - Suffer physical harm.</li>
     <li>Network - Place your relationship to your web of contacts above the mission.</li>
     <li>Protective - Place your responsibility to a person, place, or thing you have promised to protect above the mission.</li>
     <li>Prudent - Resolve a charged situation without violence.</li>
     <li>Revealing - When you discover more information about a personal mystery in your past.</li>
     <li>Vengeful - Place a personal grudge against an individual or organization above the mission.</li>
     <li>Violent - Deliberately use violence to overcome a problem when a non-violent option exists.</li>
    </ul>
