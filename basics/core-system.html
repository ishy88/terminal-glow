    <h5>Judgment Calls</h5>
    <p>When you play, you’ll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? Can this person be swayed? Must we get out the tools and tinker with this old rusty lock, or could it also be quietly finessed? The players have final say.</li>
     <li>How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this circumstance? How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very little or a whole lot? The GM has final say.</li>
     <li>Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given circumstance? Does this fall from the roof break your leg? Do the constables merely become suspicious or do they already have you trapped? The GM has final say.</li>
     <li>Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? Is your character in position to make an move? The GM has final say.</li>
     <li>Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character and crew advancement? Did you express your character’s beliefs, drives, heritage, or background? You tell us. The players have final say.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Making Moves and Rolling the Dice</h5>
    <p>Most moves include the phrase “roll +x” where “x” is one of your character’s attributes (Meat for example). Unless the move tells you otherwise, that “roll” always means that you roll two six-sided dice and add their results to the value of the modifier. Some moves will have you add some other value to your roll instead of or in addition to an attribute.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>If you roll a 10 or higher, it’s a full success—things go well. If you roll 13 or higher, it’s a critical success—gain some additional minor advantage.</li>
     <li>If you roll between a 7 and a 9, that’s a partial success—you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.</li>
     <li>If you roll a 6 or lower, it’s a bad outcome. Things go poorly. You probably don’t achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to making moves, there is another type of roll that will come up in-game. The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. How loyal is an NPC? How much of the system does the virus compromise? How much evidence is zeroed before the authorities kick in the door?</p>

    <h5>The Game Structure</h5>
    <p>Terminal Glow has a structure to play, with four parts. By default, the game is in free play—characters talk to each other, they go places, they do things, they make rolls as needed.</p>
    <p>When the group is ready, they choose a target for their next operation, then choose a type of plan to employ. This triggers the engagement roll (which establishes the situation as the operation starts) and then the game shifts into the mission phase.</p>
    <p>During the mission, the PCs engage the target—they make rolls, overcome obstacles, call for flashbacks, and complete the operation (successfully or not). When the mission is finished, the game shifts into the downtime phase.</p>
    <p>During the downtime phase, the GM engages the systems for payoff, heat, and entanglements, to determine all the fallout from the score. Then the PCs each get their downtime activities, such as getting their fix to remove stress or working on a long-term project. When all the downtime activities are complete, the game returns to free play and the cycle starts over again.</p>
    <p>The phases are a conceptual model to help you organize the game. They’re not meant to be rigid structures that restrict your options (this is why they’re presented as amorphous blobs of ink without hard edges). Think of the phases as a menu of options to fit whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish in play. Each phase suits a different goal.</p>
