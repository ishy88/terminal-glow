    <h5>Resistance</h5>
    <p>When your PC suffers a consequence that you don't like, you can choose to resist it. Just tell the GM, “No, I don’t think so. I’m resisting that.” Resistance is always automatically effective—the GM will tell you if the consequence is reduced in severity or if you avoid it entirely. Then, you’ll make the <i>resist</i> move to see how much stress your character suffers as a result of their resistance.</p>
    <p>You make the roll using one of your character’s attributes chosen from Cool, Meat, and Style. The GM chooses the attribute, based on the nature of consequences:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Cool: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.</li>
     <li>Meat: Consequences from physical strain or injury.</li>
     <li>Style: Consequences from deception or understanding.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your character suffers 6 stress when they resist, minus the highest die result from the resistance roll. So, if you rolled a 4, you’d suffer 2 stress. If you rolled a 6, you’d suffer zero stress. If you get two or more sixes, you also clear 1 stress.</p>
    <p>Usually, a resistance roll reduces the severity of a consequence. If you’re going to suffer fatal harm, for example, a resistance roll would reduce the harm to severe, instead. Or if you got a complication when you were sneaking into the penthouse apartment, and the GM was going to mark three ticks on the “Alert” clock, she’d only mark two (or maybe one) if you resisted the complication.</p>
    <p>You may only roll against a given consequence once.</p>
    <p>The GM also has the option to rule that your character completely avoids the consequence. For instance, maybe you’re in a shootout and the consequence is getting disarmed. When you resist, the GM says that you avoid that consequence completely: you keep hold of your weapon.</p>
    <p>By adjusting which consequences are reduced vs. which are avoided, the GM establishes the overall tone of your game. For a more daring game, most consequences will be avoided. For a grittier game, most consequences will only be reduced with resistance.</p>
    <p>The GM may also threaten several consequences at once, then the player may choose which ones to resist (and make rolls for each).</p>
    <p>Once you decide to resist a consequence and roll, you suffer the stress indicated. You can’t roll first and see how much stress you’ll take, then decide whether or not to resist.</p>

    <h5>Armor</h5>
    <p>Each character sheet has a set of three boxes to track usage of armor (standard, heavy, and special). If you have a type of armor that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist.</p>
    <p>When an armor box is marked, it can’t be used again until it’s restored. All of your armor is restored when you choose your load for the next score.</p>

    <p><b>Special Armor</b></p>
    <p>Some playbook moves refer to your special armor.  If you have any abilities that use your special armor, tick its box when you activate one of them. If you don’t have any special abilities that use special armor, then you can’t use that armor box at all.</p>

    <h5>Death</h5>
    <p>There are a couple ways for a PC to die:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>If they suffer level 4 fatal harm and they don’t resist it, they die. Sometimes this is a choice a player wants to make, because they feel like it wouldn’t make sense for the character to survive or it seems right for their character to die here.</li>
     <li>If they need to record harm at level 3 and it’s already filled, they suffer a catastrophic consequence, which might mean sudden death (depending on the circumstances).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When your character dies, you have options:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>You can create a brand new character who joins the crew.</li>
     <li>You can "promote" an existing NPC gang member to a PC.</li>
    </ul>
