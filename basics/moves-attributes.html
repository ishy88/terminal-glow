    <h5>Attributes</h5>
    <p>There are five attributes in Terminal Glow that the player characters use to make moves:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Cool - Your ability to remain calm and focused in stressful situations.</li>
     <li>Edge - Your street-savvy and ability to give the impression that you are a badass.</li>
     <li>Meat - Your physical talents without the aid of cyberware.</li>
     <li>Mind - Your mental abilities: logic, instict, reasoning, creativity, or any other mental process.</li>
     <li>Style - Your charisma, presence, or nerve.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The rating for each attribute is a bonus or penalty, ranging from -1 to +3.</p>

    <h5>Moves</h5>
    <p>The most basic unit of rules in Terminal Glow is a move. A move is a passage of text triggered when your character takes a discreet action within the fiction that specifies which attribute to roll and assigns specific benefits or drawbacks to the die results. As stated in the basic rules overview, a 10+ will always be a full success, a 7-9 will be a bonus with some drawback, and a 6- will either be an outright failure or a success at a steep cost.</p>

    <h5>Basic Moves</h5>
    <p>The following moves are considered basic moves. They are moves that any character can trigger, regardless of playbook.</p>

    <p><b>Act Under Pressure (Cool)</b></p>
    <p>When you race against the clock, act while in danger or act to avoid danger, roll +Cool:</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>10+:</b> You do it, no problem.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>7-9:</b> You stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.</p>

    <p><b>Assess (Edge)</b></p>
    <p>When you closely study a person, place or situation, or when you quickly size up an opponent or a charged situation, roll +Edge:</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>10+:</b> Gain 3 hold.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>7-9:</b> Gain 1 hold.</p>
    <p>In the ensuing action, you may spend 1 hold at any time to ask the GM a question from the list below if your examination could have revealed the answer. The GM may ask you questions to clarify your intent. Gain a +1 bonus to your next roll while acting on the answer to each question.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>What potential complication do I need to be wary of?</li>
     <li>What do I notice despite an effort to conceal it?</li>
     <li>How is ______ vulnerable to me?</li>
     <li>How can I avoid trouble or hide here?</li>
     <li>What is my best way in/out/past?</li>
     <li>Where can I gain the most advantage?</li>
     <li>Who or what is my biggest threat in this situation?</li>
     <li>Who or what is in control here?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Declare a Contact (None)</b></p>
    <p>When you need to call in a favour from a new contact, name and describe the Contact, then say why the Contact owes you a favour or why you owe them a favour. The GM will ask you some questions about the Contact and your relationship. Add the Contact to your list (no roll required!).</p>
    <p>You can only <i>declare a contact</i> once per mission, although certain playbook moves may allow you to gain more contacts in similar ways.</p>

    <p><b>Fast Talk (Style)</b></p>
    <p>When you try to convince someone to do what you want with promises, lies or bluster, roll +Style:</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>10+:</b> NPCs do what you want. PCs choose whether to do it or not. If they do, they mark experience. If they don’t, they must <i>act under pressure</i> to go against your stated wishes.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>7-9:</b> NPCs do it, but someone will find out: Your crew takes 1 heat. For PCs, choose whether they mark experience if they do what you want or if they must <i>act under pressure</i> to go against your stated wishes. Then it's up to them.</p>

    <p><b>Hack the Planet (Mind)</b></p>
    <p>Special: While it's possible to <i>hack the planet</i> without the aid of a neural interface and a cyberdeck, a character who lacks these objects will not be able to fully interface with the machine. Hacking attempts that do not use both of these items take -2 and cannot select to suffer harm on a 9-.</p>
    <p>When you attempt to hack a system with a specific objective in mind, state that objective and roll +Mind:</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>10+:</b> You accomplish your goal, no strings attached.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>7-9:</b> You’re in, but choose one:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Your physical location is logged.</li>
     <li>Your identity is compromised.</li>
     <li>You suffer 1 harm from lethal feedback algorithms.</li>
     <li>An alarm is triggered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&emsp;<b>6-:</b> You’re locked out and the GM chooses two.</p>

    <p><b>Hit the Street (Style)</b></p>
    <p>When you go to a Contact for help, roll +Style:</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>10+:</b> You get what you want, for the standard price.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>7-9:</b> You get what you want, but choose 2 from the list below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your request is going to cost you extra cash or resources.</li>
      <li>Your request is going to take some time to put together.</li>
      <li>Your request is going to attract unwanted attention, complications, or consequences.</li>
      <li>Your contact needs you to help them out with something. If you turn them down take -1 ongoing to this move till you make it right.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Mix it Up (Meat)</b></p>
    <p>When you use violence against an armed force to seize control of an objective, state that objective and roll +Meat:</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>10+:</b> You take control of your objective.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>7-9:</b> You take control of your objective, but choose two:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>You make too much noise. Your crew takes 1 heat.</li>
     <li>You suffer harm appropriate to the situation.</li>
     <li>An ally suffers harm appropriate to the situation.</li>
     <li>Something of value is broken.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Play Hardball (Edge)</b></p>
    <p>When you get in someone's face threatening violence and you intend to carry through, roll +Edge:</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>10+:</b> NPCs will do what you want. PCs can either do what you want or suffer an appropriate consequence.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>7-9:</b> For NPCs, the GM chooses 1:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>They attempt to remove you as a threat, but not before suffering appropriate consequences.</li>
     <li>They do it, but they want payback. Lose 1 status with a relevant faction.</li>
     <li>They do it, but they tell someone about it. Your crew takes 1 heat.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PCs again choose to either do what you want or suffer an appropriate consequence, but they gain a +1 bonus to their next roll to act against you.</p>

    <p><b>Research (Mind)</b></p>
    <p>When you investigate a person, place, object, or service using a library, dossier or database (or combination of them), ask a question from the list below and roll +Mind:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Where would I find ______?</li>
     <li>How secure is ______?</li>
     <li>Who or what is related to ______?</li>
     <li>Who owned or employed ______?</li>
     <li>Who or what is ______ most valuable to?</li>
     <li>What is the relationship between ______ and ______?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&emsp;<b>10+:</b> The GM will answer your question & answer a follow-up question from the list as well.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>7-9:</b> The GM will answer your question.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>6-:</b> The GM will answer your question and decide on a consequence.</p>

    <p><b>Resist (Variable)</b></p>
    <p>When you attempt to resist a consequence inflicted on your character the GM chooses to either downgrade the consequence or clear it entirely, then roll a number of dice equal to 1 + your rating in the most relevant attribute chosen from Cool, Meat, and Style. Suffer stress equal to 6 - the highest value of the die rolled. If you roll two sixes, additionally clear one stress.</p>
    <p>If the number of dice you roll to resist would be reduced below 1, instead roll two dice and suffer stress equal to 6 - the lowest value of the die rolled. Two sixes rolled in this way do not clear any stress.</p>

    <h5>Teamwork Moves</h5>
    <p>Additional moves that any PC can preform are detailed in <a href="#mission/teamwork">Teamwork</a>. These teamwork moves all relate to aiding or otherwise working with the rest of your crew.</p>
