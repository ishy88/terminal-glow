    <h5>Fortune Roll</h5>
    <p>The fortune roll is a tool the GM can use to disclaim decision making. You use a fortune roll in two different ways:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>When you need to make a determination about a situation the PCs aren’t directly involved in and don’t want to simply decide the outcome.</li>
     <li>When an outcome is uncertain, but no other roll applies to the situation at hand.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you make a fortune roll you may assess any number of traits to determine the bonus to the roll. For example:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>When a faction takes an action with uncertain outcome, you might use their Tier rating to make a fortune roll.</li>
     <li>When a gang operates independently, use their quality rating for a fortune roll.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If no trait applies, roll 2d6 for sheer luck or come up with a bonus (usually from +0 to +3) based on the situation at hand. If two parties are directly opposed, make a fortune roll for each side to see how they do, then assess the outcome of the situation by comparing their rolls.</p>
    <p>The fortune roll is also a good tool to help the GM manage all the various moving parts of the world. Sometimes a quick roll is enough to answer a question or inspire an idea for what might happen next.</p>
