    <h5>Loadout</h5>
    <p>You have access to all of the items on your character sheet. For each operation, decide what your character’s load will be. During the operation, you may say that your character has an item on hand by checking the box for the item you want to use—up to a number of items equal to your chosen load. Your load also determines your movement speed and conspicuousness:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>1-3 load: Light. You’re faster, less conspicuous; you blend in with citizens.</li>
     <li>4/5 load: Normal. You look like a scoundrel, ready for trouble.</li>
     <li>6 load: Heavy. You’re slower. You look like an operative on a mission.</li>
     <li>7-9 load: Encumbered. You’re overburdened and can’t do anything except move very slowly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some advances increase the load limits.</p>
    <p>Items with two connected boxes count as two items for load. Items in italics do not contribute to your load limit.</p>
    <p>You don’t need to select specific items until they come up in play. For now, review the standard item descriptions.</p>

    <h5>Gear</h5>
    <p>Common gear is as follows. If you wish to bring special or rare gear not listed here on a mission, you'll probably have to <i>hit the street</i> for it.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A Pistol - Flechette, holdout, fully automatic, revolver; sky's the limit, as long as it fits in one hand. [1 load]</li>
     <li>A 2nd Pistol [1 load]</li>
     <li>Melee Weapon - A sword, a knife, a taser, or even a razor whip or vibroaxe. [1 load]</li>
     <li>Large Weapon - A firearm meant for two hands. A shotgun, automatic rifle, sniper rifle, or something more exotic like a crossbow or grenade launcher. [2 load]</li>
     <li>Armor - Synthetic leathers, armoured clothing, or a reinforced jacket or coat. [2 load]</li>
     <li>Heavy Armor - Add a bulletproof vest or other heavy combat gear to regular armor. [+2 load] (4 load total)</li>
     <li>Silencer or Supressor - Choose a weapon to apply this to. Some weapons cannot be silenced. [1 load]</li>
     <li>Burglary Gear - Tape, cable, a miniature cutting torch, and good old-fashioned lockpicks and prybars. [1 load]</li>
     <li>Climbing Gear - A large coil of synthetic rope. A small coil of synthetic rope. Grappling hooks. A small pouch of chalk dust. A reinforced climbing harness. Maybe some suction cup boots. [2 load]</li>
     <li>Cyberdeck/Custom Cyberdeck - Shoebox-sized piece of tech that allows interfacing with most objects with a computer chip and wireless capability. A necessity for hacking. Characters with a custom cyberdeck can bring theirs rather than a generic off-the-shelf version. [1 load]</li>
     <li>Tinkering Tools - Allows for field repairs and modifactions to electronics and cyberware. [1 load]</li>
     <li>Demolition Tools - A sledgehammer and steel spikes. Heavy drill. Crowbar. Explosives not included. [2 load]</li>
     <li>Smartphone - A basic smartphone with net access and communications capabilities. Encrypted, but not particularly well. [0 load]</li>
     <li>Tablet - A basic tablet computer with net access and a variety of programs installed. Encrypted, but not particularly well. [1 load]</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Cyberware</h5>
    <p>The easiest way to obtain new cyberware is to take it as an advance, but cyberware obtained in this manner must be paid for just like your starting cyberware. It's also possible for your character to obtain and surgically install new cyberware through some sort of activity in downtime, perhaps a long term project that asks you to <i>hit the street</i> a couple times. Regardless of how it's obtained, once installed cyberware follows the same rules, depending on the type of cyberware installed. You can ony benefit from one piece of cyberware on any given roll.</p>
    <p>Common cyberware is as follows. If you're after something not on this list, talk to your GM about it.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Cybereyes - When you have cybereyes installed, choose two of the following: thermographic, light amplification, magnification, flare compensation, recording, wireless connection. When your enhanced sight helps, you may add a +1 bonus to <i>assess</i>.</li>
     <li>Cyberears - When you have cyberears installed, choose two of the following: dampening, wide frequency, recording, wireless connection. When your enhanced hearing helps, you may add a +1 bonus to <i>assess</i>.</li>
     <li>Cybercomms - An internal headware implant that allows thought-activated communication. When you have cybercomms installed, choose two of the following: encrypted, jamming, recording, satellite relay. When monitoring communications or giving orders in a tactical environment, you may add a +1 bonus to <i>assess</i>.</li>
     <li>Cyberarm - When you have a cyberarm installed, choose one of the following: augmented strength, implanted tools, retractable blades, implanted holdout firearm. Additional options can be added to your cyberarm later in the same way as adding new cyberware.</li>
     <li>Cyberlegs - When your enhanced athelticism could help you <i>act under pressure</i>, add a +1 bonus to the roll.</li>
     <li>Dermal Plating - You always count as equipped with armor and it no longer contibutes towards your load limit. Heavy armor must still be chosen for 2 additional load as normal.</li>
     <li>Implant Weaponry - When you have implant weaponry installed, choose one of the following: retractable blades, a holdout firearm, an internal asssassination implant.</li>
     <li>Muscle Grafts - You have enhanced strength. When you <i>mix it up</i> with a melee weapon, add a +1 bonus to the roll.</li>
     <li>Neural Interface - An internal headware implant that converts the brain's neural signals to machine control impulses. When you have a neural interface installed, choose one:
     <ul>
      <li>Data Storage - Your neural interface can tap into the net. When you install this neural interface option, choose two: encrypted, high capacity, high speed. When you <i>research</i> internally or externally stored data, ask another question on a hit.</li>
      <li>Remote Control Module - An encrypted interface which includes wireless broadcast and reception capacity allowing remote control of vehicles and drones.</li>
      <li>Targeting Suite - Your neural interface can create a direct link with a hand-held gun to project targeting information into the user's vision. When you fire a cyber-linked weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to <i>mix it up</i>. In addition, you can precisely define the area of effect for fully automatic weaponry.</li>
     </ul>
     <li>Synthetic Nerves - When you <i>mix it up</i> against enemies without synthetic nerves, you gain a +1 bonus to the roll.

     <li>Skillwires - A hardware system which can simulate the instincts and actions of an expert practitioner of a variety of skills. Skillwires can accomodate up to two skillchips at once. When you make a move using the skills associated with one of your slotted skillchips and your relevant attribute is +1 or less, you gain a +1 bonus to the roll. When you have skillwires installed, they come with two skillchips. Example skillchips include: martial arts, breaking and entering, rock climbing, skydiving, scuba diving, planning and logistics, firefight combat, extreme driving, parkour, first aid, military history and tactics.</li>
