		<h5>Playbooks</h5>
    <p>Every player character is familiar with all of the various feats represented by the basic moves. They're all able to <i>mix it up</i> in a shootout, <i>fast talk</i> a guard or a suit, <i>assess</i> a tricky situation, <i>declare a contact</i> to hit up for information, and so on.</p>
    <p>That said, you'll also have your specializations and skills, the qualities that make your character uniquely effective. The sheet with all the specific rules for these specializations and skills is called a playbook in Terminal Glow.</p>
    <p>When you choose a playbook, you're choosing a set of moves that you gain access to on top of the basic moves, a list of advances from which your character can take as many as they like as they gain experience, and what cyberware your character begins play with. But every playbook represents a skilled professional. The Killer has special abilities related to violence, but that doesn't mean they're "the fighter" of the game. Any character type can fight well. Think of your playbook as an area of focus and preference, but not a unique skill set.</p>
    <p>This is why we call them "playbooks" rather than "character classes" or "archetypes." You're selecting the set of initial actions and abilities that your character has access toâ€”but you're not defining their immutable essence or true nature. Your character will grow and change over time; who they become is part of the fun of playing the game.</p>
    <p>Once you've chosen your playbook, follow the steps below to complete your character:</p>

    <p><b>Choose a Background</b></p>
    <p>Your character's background describes what they did before they joined the crew. Come up with a few words that describe their pre-crew life and write them down.</p>

    <p><b>Assign Attributes</b></p>
    <p>Assign the following numbers to the six stats (Style, Edge, Cool, Mind, and Meat): +2, +1, +1, +0, -1. Each playbook has one or two stats that are more
important because they are used for certain basic and playbook moves that are central to that playbook. You'll probably want to assign a +2 or +1 to those stats, but it's not required.</p>

    <p><b>Choose Playbook Moves</b></p>
    <p>Each playbook gives you one or two starting moves. Some may require you to choose mechanical or fictional details about that move. Make those choices now.
    <p>Each playbook also gives you a number of options for additional starting moves. Choose which of those moves your character has now as well.</p>

    <p><b>Choose Cyberware</b></p>
    <p>Choose pieces of Cyberware according to the instructions in your playbook. The GM will ask you two questions:
    <ol>
     <li>Why did you get part of your body cut out and replaced with electronics? Choose one: prosthetic, forced, loyalty, enthusiasm, necessity, junkie, genetics, career, ideology, memory, military.</li>
     <li>How did you afford to have someone cut out part of your body and replace it with electronics? Choose one:
     <ul>
      <li>You scrimped and saved to buy it yourself. Choose one to apply to that piece of cyberware: unreliable, substandard, hardware decay, damaging.</li>
      <li>Someone else paid for it; now you owe them. You're owned. Describe who owns you.</li>
      <li>You fucked someone over to get it. You're hunted. Describe who you double-crossed.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The MC will make a note of who owns you, who's hunting you, the gear you have installed in your body, and any technical problems it might have. Be sure to choose options that will be fun for you; your choice tells the MC which complication you find most interesting for your character.</p>

    <p><b>Choose Your Fix</b></p>
    <p>Every character needs to get some fix or another, which they indulge to deal with stress. Choose a fix from the list, and describe it with the specific details and the name and location of your fix trafficker.
    <ul>
     <li>Gambling: You crave games of chance, betting on sporting events, etc.</li>
     <li>Luxury: Expensive or ostentatious displays of opulence.</li>
     <li>Obligation: You're devoted to a family, a cause, an organization, a charity, etc.</li>
     <li>Pleasure: Gratification from lovers, food, drink, drugs, art, theater, etc.</li>
     <li>Stupor: You seek oblivion in the abuse of drugs, drinking to excess, getting beaten to a pulp in underground fighting rings, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Choose Your Directive</b></p>
    <p>Following directives is one of the ways in which Terminal Glow characters earn experience. Choose or write a directive that reflects your character's personal motivations. Part of the GM's agenda is to make these directives relevant, so make your choices based on tricky situations you want to see your character in. Directives are described in more detail in <a href="#basics/advancement">Advancement</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Record Your Name, Handle, and Look</b></p>
    <p>Choose a name for your character. If your character uses an alias or nickname in the underworld, make a note of it. Record a few evocative words that describe your character's look.</p>

    <p>That's it! Your character is ready for play. When you start the first session, the GM might ask you some questions about who you are, your outlook, or some past events. If you don't know the answers, make some up. Or ask the other players for ideas.</p>
