    <h5>Flashbacks</h5>
    <p>The rules don't distinguish between actions performed in the present moment and those performed in the past. When an operation is underway, you can invoke a flashback to roll for an action in the past that impacts your current situation. Maybe you convinced the corporate police lieutenant to cancel the patrol tonight, so you try to <i>fast talk</i> to see how that went.</p>
    <p>The GM sets a stress cost when you activate a flashback action.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>0 Stress: An ordinary action for which you had easy opportunity. Consorting with a friend to agree to arrive at the card game ahead of time, to suddenly spring out as a surprise ally.</li>
     <li>1 Stress: A complex action or unlikely opportunity. Finessing your pistol into a hiding spot near the card table so you could retrieve them after the pat-down at the front door.</li>
     <li>>2 (or more) Stress: An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies. Having already studied the exec's family life and learned his mother's maiden name—a clue that can be used to reset his computer password.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the stress cost is paid, a flashback action is handled just like any other action. Sometimes it will entail making a move, because there's some danger or trouble involved. Sometimes a flashback will entail a fortune roll, because we just need to find out how well (or how much, or how long, etc.). Sometimes a flashback won't call for a roll at all because you can just pay the stress and it's accomplished.</p>
    <p>If a flashback involves a downtime activity, pay 1 coin or 1 rep for it, instead of stress.</p>
    <p>One of the best uses for a flashback is when the engagement roll goes badly. After the GM describes the trouble you're in, you can call for a flashback to a special preparation you made, "just in case" something like this happened. This way, your "flashback planning' will be focused on the problems that actually happen, not the problems that might happen.</p>

    <h5>Limits of Flashbacks</h5>
    <p>A flashback isn't time travel. It can't “undo” something that just occurred in the present moment. For instance, if a detective confronts you about recent thefts of experimental tech when you're at the socialite's party, you can't call for a flashback to assassinate the detective the night before. She's here now, questioning you—that's established in the fiction. You can call for a flashback to show that you intentionally tipped off the detective so she would confront you at the party—so you could use that opportunity to impress the socialite with your aplomb and daring.</p>
