    <h5>Teamwork</h5>
    <p>When the team of PCs works together, the characters have access to three special teamwork moves:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><i>Assist</i> another PC who's rolling an action.</li>
     <li><i>Protect</i> a teammate.</li>
     <li><i>Set up</i> a character who will follow through on your action.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Assist</b></p>
    <p>When you assist another player who's rolling, describe what your character does to help. Take 1 stress and give them a +1 bonus to their roll. You might also suffer any consequences that occur because of the roll, depending on the circumstances. Only one character may assist a given roll. If you really want to help and someone else is already assisting, consider performing a setup move instead.</p>

    <p><b>Protect</b></p>
    <p>You step in to face a consequence that one of your teammates would otherwise face. You suffer it instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal. Describe how you intervene.</p>
    <p>This is how you do "I'll dive in front of the bullet" scene. You cover for a teammate, suffering any harm or consequences that still linger after you've rolled to resist. It hurts, cost stress, and may leave you in a bad spot. But hey, you're a hero.</p>

    <p><b>Set Up</b></p>
    <p>When you perform a setup action, you have an indirect effect on an obstacle. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver either accomplishes more on a success or suffers reduced consequences on a failure. You choose the benefit based on the nature of your setup action.</p>
    <p>This is how you do the "I'll create a distraction" scene. You <i>fast talk</i> to distract a constable with your charms, then any teammate who follows through by <i>acting under pressure</i> to sneak past won't face as many consequences on a failure. It's less risky since you're drawing the guard's attention.</p>
    <p>This is a good way to contribute to an operation when you don't have a good rating in the attribute that'd usually be needed. A clever setup action lets you help the team indirectly. Multiple follow-up actions may take advantage of your setup as long as it makes sense in the fiction.</p>

    <p><b>Do We Have to Use Teamwork?</b></p>
    <p>Teamwork moves are options, not requirements. Each character can still perform solo actions as normal during an operation. If your character can't communicate or somehow coordinate with the rest of the team, you can't use or benefit from any teamwork moves.</p>
