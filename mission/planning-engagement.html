    <h5>Planning and Engagement</h5>
    <p>Your crew spends time planning each mission. They huddle around a rickety table in their lair, looking at scrawled maps, whispering plots and schemes, bickering about the best approach, lamenting the dangers ahead, and lusting after stacks of cash.</p>
    <p>But you, the players, don't have to do the nitty-gritty planning. The characters take care of that, off-screen. All you have to do is choose what type of plan the characters have already made. There's no need to sweat all the little details and try to cover every eventuality ahead of time, because the engagement roll (detailed below) ultimately determines how much trouble you're in when the plan is put in motion. No plan is ever perfect. You can't account for everything. This system assumes that there's always some unknown factors and trouble—major or minor—in every operation; you just have to make the best of it.</p>
    <p>There are six different types of plan, each with a missing detail you need to provide. To "plan an operation," simply choose the plan and supply the detail. Then the GM will cut to the action as the first moments of the operation unfold.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Assault — Do violence to a target. Detail: The point of attack.</li>
     <li>Deception — Lure, trick, or manipulate. Detail: The method of deception.</li>
     <li>Stealth — Trespass unseen. Detail: The point of infiltration.</li>
     <li>Net — Delve into cyberspace. Detail: The access point.</li>
     <li>Social — Negotiate, bargain, or persuade. Detail: The social connection.</li>
     <li>Transport — Carry cargo or people through danger. Detail: The route and means.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>The Detail</h5>
    <p>When you choose a plan, you provide a missing detail, like the point of attack, social connection, etc. If you don't know the detail, you can gather information in some way to discover it.</p>

    <h5>Item Loadouts</h5>
    <p>After the plan and detail are in place, each player chooses their character's load. This indicates how much stuff they're carrying on the operation. They don't have to select individual items—just the maximum amount they'll have access to during the action.</p>

    <h5>Engagement Roll</h5>
    <p>Once the players choose a plan and provide its detail, the GM cuts to the action—describing the scene as the crew starts the operation and encounters their first obstacle. But how is this established? The way the GM describes the starting situation can have a huge impact on how simple or troublesome the operation turns out to be. Rather than expecting the GM to simply "get it right" each time, we use a dice roll instead. This is the engagement roll.</p>
    <p>The engagement roll is a fortune roll, starting with 2d6 for sheer luck. Modify the roll for any major advantages or disadvantages that apply.</p>

    <p><b>Major Advantages</b></p>
    <ul>
     <li>Is this operation particularly bold or daring? Add +1.</li>
     <li>Does the plan's detail expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they're weakest? Add +1.</li>
     <li>Can any of your friends or contacts provide aid or insight for this operation? Add +1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Major Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul>
     <li>Is this operation overly complex or contingent on many factors? Subtract -1.</li>
     <li>Is the target strongest against this approach, or do they have particular defenses or special preparations? Subtract -1.</li>
     <li>Are any enemies or rivals interfering in the operation? Subtract -1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Are there any other elements that you want to consider? Maybe a lower-Tier target will give you +1. Maybe a higher-Tier target will give you -1. Maybe there's a situation in the district that makes the operation more or less tricky.</p>

    <p>The engagement roll assumes that the PCs are approaching the target as intelligently as they can, given the plan and detail they provided, so we don't need to play out tentative probing maneuvers, special precautions, or other ponderous non-action. The engagement roll covers all of that. The PCs are already in action, facing the first obstacle—up on the rooftop, hacking the lock on the window; kicking down the door of the rival gang's lair; maneuvering to speak with a a prominent executive at the banquet; etc.</p>
    <p>Don't make the engagement roll and then describe the PCs approaching the target. It's the approach that the engagement roll resolves. Cut to the action that results because of that initial approach—to the first serious obstacle in their path.</p>
    <p>If the players want to include a special preparation or clever setup, they can do so with flashbacks during the mission. This takes some getting used to. Players may balk at first, worried that you're skipping over important things that they want to do. But jumping straight into the action of the mission is much more effective once you get used to it. When they see the situation they're in, their "planning" in flashbacks will be focused and useful, rather than merely speculations on circumstances and events that might not even happen.</p>

    <h5>Outcomes</h5>
    <p>The outcome of the engagement roll determines the position the PCs find themselves in when we cut to the mission in progress:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>13+: You've already overcome the first obstacle and are ready for what's next.</li>
     <li>10-12: You're in a controlled position when the action starts.</li>
     <li>7-9: You're in a risky position when the action starts.</li>
     <li>6-: You're in a desperate position when the action starts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No matter how low-Tier or outmatched you are, a desperate position is the worst thing that can result from the plan + detail + engagement process. It's designed this way so the planning process matters, but it doesn't call for lots of optimization or nitpicking. Even if you're reckless and just dive in and take your chances, you can't get too badly burned.</p>
    <p>When you describe the situation after the roll, use the details of the target to paint a picture of the PCs' position. How might the strange, tweaker gang present a desperate position for burglars? How might the violent and ruthless mercs present a risky threat to assaulting thugs? How might the vain and pristine exec present a controlled opportunity for a manipulative scoundrel? Use this opportunity to show how the PCs' enemies are dangerous and capable—don't characterize a bad engagement roll as a failure by the PCs, or they won't trust the technique in the future. Sure, things are starting out desperate here against the creepy simstim addicts, but you're just the type of characters who are daring enough to take them on. Let's get to it.</p>

    <p><b>How long does it last?</b></p>
    <p>The engagement roll determines the starting position for the PCs' actions. How long does that hold? Does the situation stay desperate? No. Once the initial actions have been resolved, you follow the normal process for establishing the rest of the rolls during the score. The engagement roll is a quick short-hand to kick things off and get the action started—it doesn't have any impact after that.</p>

    <h5>Linked Plans</h5>
    <p>Sometimes an operation seems to call for a couple of plans linked together. A common scenario is a team that wants a two-pronged approach. "You create a diversion at the club, and when they send thugs over there, we'll break into their lair." There are two ways to handle this.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The diversion is a setup maneuver that a team member performs as part of the plan. A successful setup maneuver can improve position for teammates (possibly offsetting a bad engagement roll) or give increased effect. An unsuccessful setup maneuver might cause trouble for the second part of the plan—an easy consequence is to subtract -1 from the engagement roll. If it makes sense, the team member who performed the setup can drift back into the main operation and join the team later so they don't have to sit out and wait.</li>
     <li>The diversion is its own plan, engagement, and operation, whose outcome creates the opportunity for a future plan. Use this option when the first part of the plan is required for the next part to happen at all. For example, you might execute a stealth plan to steal an piece of tech from the underground research facility, then later use that tech in an net plan to break some next-level encryption. In this case, you go into downtime (and payoff, heat, etc.) after the first part of the plan, as normal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Either approach is fine. It's usually a question of interest. Is the linked plan idea interesting enough on its own to play out moment by moment? Is it required for the second plan to make sense? If so, make it a separate operation. If not, just use a setup maneuver.</p>

    <h5>Giving up on a Mission</h5>
    <p>When you give up on a mission, you go into downtime. You still follow the normal phases for downtime. You'll usually have zero payoff, since you didn't accomplish anything. You'll still face heat and entanglements as usual.</p>
