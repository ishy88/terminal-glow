    <h5>Crew Creation</h5>
    <p>After creating characters, take the following steps as a group to create a crew.</p>

    <p><b>Choose a Crew Type</b></p>
    <p>Your crew type determines the scores that you'll focus on, as well as a selection of special abilities that support that kind of action. The crew type isn't meant to be restrictive—a crew of smugglers might sometimes engage in extortion or sell contraband—but the core activity of the crew type is the most frequent way they earn coin and xp for advancement, but it does provide your crew with a directive related to their type that your crew will gain xp if they follow.</p>
    <p>Like a character playbook, your crew type is also how you're known in the underworld. The criminal factions and institutions think of you as "assassins" or "vice dealers" etc., and will treat you accordingly.</p>
    <p>Your crew begins with 2 cash in its coffers (the remains of the PCs' savings). You are Tier 0, with strong grip and 0 rep.</p>

    <p><b>Choose an Initial Reputation and Lair</b></p>
    <p>Your crew has just formed and acquired a lair. Given this group of characters and their previous escapades, what initial reputation would you have among the factions of the underworld? Choose one from the list below (or create your own).</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Ambitious</li>
     <li>Brutal</li>
     <li>Daring</li>
     <li>Honorable</li>
     <li>Professional</li>
     <li>Savvy</li>
     <li>Subtle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You earn crew xp when you bolster your crew's reputation, so think of this as another cue to indicate what sorts of action you want in the game. Will you be recklessly ambitious, targeting higher-Tier targets? Will you take on daring scores that others deem too risky? Will you operate subtly, keeping to the shadows?</p>
    <p>Also, talk about where the crew makes its lair. You begin at Tier 0, so it's probably a very modest or abandoned sort of place.</p>

   <p><b>Establish Your Hunting Grounds</b></p>
    <p>Your crew is brand-new, but you have chosen some small part of a district as your hunting grounds. This is the area that you usually target for your missions, and you know it well. Your hunting grounds don't have to be close to your lair. The area is small-but it's still an intrusion on someone. The GM will tell you which faction claims the area, then you decide how to deal with them:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Pay them off. Give them 1 cash in exchange for giving you room to work.</li>
     <li>Pay the faction 2 cash as a show of respect and gain +1 status with them.</li>
     <li>Keep your money and take -1 status with that faction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your hunting grounds are useful for a particular type of criminal operation. Each crew type has a list of different operation types for their hunting grounds. For instance, Assassins have Accident, Disappearance, Murder, or Ransom as options. Choose one of these operation types as your preference.</p>
    <p>When you prepare to execute an operation of your preferred type on your hunting grounds, you get a +1 bonus to any attempts to <i>hit the street</i> and a free additional downtime activity to contribute to that operation. This can help you discover an opportunity, acquire an asset you might need for the job, find an appropriate client, etc.</p>
    <p>When you acquire turf you also expand the size and/or type of your hunting grounds. Detail the new area and/or methods with help from the GM.</p>

    <p><b>Choose an Advance</b></p>
    <p>Like character playbooks, crew playbooks have a variety of advances to choose from. Take a look at the advances for your crew and choose one to start with. It's important to pick an advance that everyone is excited about. You can get more advances in the future by earning xp.</p>
    <p>Just like picking the crew type, reputation, lair, and hunting grounds, choosing an advance is another chance to focus the game down to a more specific range of possibilities. That's a lot to work with, and it helps get the game going in a strong direction from the very beginning.</p>

    <p><b>Assign Crew Upgrades</b></p>
    <p>An upgrade is a valuable asset that helps the crew in some way, like a getaway vehicle or a gang of lackeys. Each crew type has two pre-selected upgrades that suit that crew. You get to add two additional upgrades to your new crew (so you'll have a total of four upgrades when you start). You can choose from the specific upgrades available to your crew type or the general upgrades on the crew sheet.</p>
    <p>When you assign your two upgrades, the GM will tell you about two factions that are impacted by your choices:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>One faction helped you get an upgrade. They like you, and you get +1 status with them. At your option, spend 1 cash to repay their kindness, and take +2 status with them instead.</li>
     <li>One faction was screwed over when you got an upgrade. They don't like you, and you get -2 status with them. At your option, spend 1 cash to mollify them, and take -1 status with them instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll be able get more upgrades in the future by earning xp.</p>

    <p><b>Choose a Favorite Contact</b></p>
    <p>Choose or create one NPC who is a close friend, long-time ally, or partner in crime. The GM will tell you about two factions that are impacted by your choice:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>One faction is also friendly with this contact, and you get +1 status with them.</li>
     <li>One faction is unfriendly with this contact, and you get -1 status with them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At your option, these factions are even more concerned with this contact and so you take +2 and -2 status instead.</p>
    <p>That's it! Your new crew is ready to begin taking on missions.</p>

    <h5>Crew Upgrades</h5>
    <p>The following are the upgrades available to your crew. For a bonus not listed here, consider a long-term project or a mission to stake a claim.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Vehicle - You have a stock vehicle (such as a boat, car, van, small truck, or helicopter), somewhere to keep it, and basic supplies to maintain it. A second uprade improves the vehicle with armor and either more speed or more cargo capacity.</li>
     <li>Cohort - A cohort is a gang or a single expert NPC who works for your crew. For all the details on cohorts, see below.</li>
     <li>Hidden Lair - Your lair has a secret location and is disguised to hide it from view. If your lair is discovered, use two downtime activities and pay cash equal to your Tier to relocate and hide it once again.</li>
     <li>Mastery - Your crew has access to master level training. Your crew gains access to a new specialized advance they can spend xp on: +1 to any one attribute (Repeatable, Up to +2). This costs four upgrade boxes to unlock.</li>
     <li>Quality - Each upgrade improves the quality rating of all the PCs' items of that type, beyond the quality established by the crew's Tier. You can improve the quality of Cyberdecks, Electronics (covers Smartphones and Tablets), Gear (covers Burglary and Climbing Gear), Tools (covers Demolition and Tinkering Tools), and Weapons.</li>
     <li>Quarters - Your lair includes living quarters for the crew. Without this upgrade, each PC sleeps elsewhere, and is vulnerable when they do.</li>
     <li>Secure Lair - Your lair has locks, alarms, and traps to thwart intuders. A second upgrade improves the defenses to include digitalu countermeasures that work against cyberattacks.</li>
     <li>Training - If you have this upgrade, you earn 2xp (instead of 1xp) when you train during downtime. This upgrade helps you advance more quickly.</li>
     <li>Vault - Your lair has a secure vault, increasing your storage capacity for cash to 8 and granting you space that can be used as a holding cell. A second upgrade increases your cash capacity to 16.</li>
     <li>Workshop - Your lair has a workshop appointed with tools for tinkering and repairs, as well as a small database of information related to creation and maintenance of devices. If your crew includes one or more Techs, this workshop is also equipped to support their area(s) of expertise. You may accomplish long-term projects with these assets without leaving your lair.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Cohorts</h5>
    <p>A cohort is a gang or an expert who works for your crew. To recruit a new cohort, spend two upgrades and create them using the process below.</p>
   
    <p><b>Creating a Gang</b></p>
    <p>Choose a gang type from the list below:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Adepts: Scholars, hackers, and technicians.</li>
     <li>Rooks: Con artists, spies, and socialites.</li>
     <li>Rovers: Smugglers, drivers, and scavengers.</li>
     <li>Skulks: Scouts, infiltrators, and thieves.</li>
     <li>Thugs: Killers, brawlers, and roustabouts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A gang has scale and quality equal to your current crew Tier. It increases in scale and quality when your crew moves up in Tier. If your crew is Tier 0, your gang is quality +0 and scale 0 (1 or 2 people). When your crew is Tier II, your gang is quality +2 and scale 2 (12 people).</p>
    <p>Some crew upgrades will add the "Elite" feature to a gang, which gives them a +1 bonus when they make a roll related to a specific one of their gang types. So, if you're Tier I and have a gang of Elite Thugs, they would roll 2d6+2 when they try to kill a target.</p>

    <p><b>Creating an Expert</b></p>
    <p>Record the expert's type (their specific area of expertise). They might be a Doctor, an Investigator, an Assassin, a Spy, etc.</p>
    <p>An expert has quality equal to your current crew Tier +1. Their scale is always zero (1 person). Your experts increase in quality when your crew moves up in Tier.</p>

    <p><b>Edges and Flaws</b></p>
    <p>When you create a cohort, give them one or two edges and an equal number of flaws.</p>
    <p>Edges</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Fearsome: The cohort is terrifying in aspect and reputation.</li>
     <li>Independent: The cohort can be trusted to make good decisions and act on their own initiative in the absence of direct orders.</li>
     <li>Loyal: The cohort can't be bribed or turned against you.</li>
     <li>Tenacious: The cohort won't be deterred from a task.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Flaws</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Principled: The cohort has an ethic or values that it won't betray for you.</li>
     <li>Savage: The cohort is excessively violent and cruel.</li>
     <li>Unreliable: The cohort isn't always available, due to other obligations, stupefaction from their fixes, etc.</li>
     <li>Wild: The cohort is drugged-up, debauched, and loud-mouthed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Modifying a Cohort</b></p>
    <p>You can add an additional type to a gang or expert by spending two crew upgrades. When a cohort performs actions for which its types apply, it uses its full quality rating. Otherwise, its quality is zero. A given cohort can have up to two types.</p>

    <p><b>Using a Cohort</b></p>
    <p>When you send a cohort to achieve a goal, roll 2d6+their quality to see how it goes. Or, a PC can oversee the maneuver. If you direct the cohort with orders, roll +Edge. If you participate in the action alongside the cohort, make the approprirate move.</p>

    <p><b>Cohort Harm and Healing</b></p>
    <p>Cohorts suffer harm similarly to PCs. A cohort can suffer four levels of harm:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Weakened. The cohort has reduced impact on a success.</li>
     <li>Impaired. The cohort operates with reduced quality (-1 to rolls).</li>
     <li>Broken. The cohort can't do anything until they recover.</li>
     <li>Dead. The cohort is destroyed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of your cohorts heal during downtime. If circumstances are amenable for recovery, each cohort removes one level of harm. A cohort can remove two levels of harm instead, if a PC spends a downtime activity helping them recuperate.</p>
    <p>If a cohort is destroyed, it may be replaced. Spend cash equal to your Tier+2 to restore it, plus two downtime activities to recruit new gang members, or hire a new expert.</p>
