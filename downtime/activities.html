    <h5>Downtime Activities</h5>
    <p>Between missions, your crew spends time at their liberty, attending to personal needs and side projects. These are called downtime activities. During a downtime phase, each PC has time for two downtime activities. When you're at war, each PC has time for only one.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Acquire Asset</li>
     <li>Long-Term Project</li>
     <li>Recover</li>
     <li>Reduce Heat</li>
     <li>Train</li>
     <li>Get Fix</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may choose the same activity more than once. You can only attempt actions that you're in a position to accomplish. If an activity is contingent on another action, resolve that action first.</p>
    <p>A PC can make time for more than two activities, at a cost. Each additional activity from the list costs 1 cash or 1 rep. This reflects the time and resulting resource drain while you're "off the clock" and not earning from a score. When you complete a new score, you reset and get two "free" activities again.</p>
    <p>Activities on the downtime list are limited; normal actions are not. During downtime, you can still go places, do things, make moves, gather information, talk with other characters, etc. In other words, only activities that are on the list are limited.</p>
    <p>For any downtime activity, add a +1 bonus to the roll if a friend or contact helps you. After the roll, you may spend coin to improve the result level by one for each coin spent. So, a 6- result becomes a 7-9, a 7-9 result becomes a 10+, and a 10+ becomes a 13+.</p>
    <p>GM: If a player can't decide which downtime activity to pick, offer them a long-term project idea. You know what the player is interested in and what they like. Suggest a project that will head in a fun direction for them.</p>

    <p><b>Acquire Asset</b></p>
    <p>Gain temporary use of an asset:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>One special item or set of common items (enough for a gang of your Tier scale).</li>
     <li>A cohort (an expert or gang).</li>
     <li>A vehicle.</li>
     <li>A service. Transport from a smuggler or driver, use of a warehouse for temporary storage, legal representation, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"Temporary use" constitutes one significant period of usage that makes sense for the asset—typically the duration of one mission. An asset may also be acquired for "standby" use in the future. You might hire a gang to guard your lair, for example, and they'll stick around until after the first serious battle, or until a week goes by and they lose interest.</p>
    <p>To acquire the asset, roll 2d6+the crew's Tier. The result indicates the quality of the asset you get, using the crew's Tier as the base. 6-: Tier -1, 7-9: Tier, 10+: Tier +1, 13+: Tier +2. You can spend coin to raise the result of this roll beyond critical by spending 2 coin per additional Tier level added.</p>
    <p>The GM may set a minimum quality level that must be achieved to acquire a particular asset. For example, if you want to get a set of police uniforms, you'd need to acquire a Tier III asset. A lower result won't do.</p>
    <p>If you acquire the same asset again, you gain a +1 bonus to your roll. If you continue to re-acquire an asset every time it's used, you can effectively rent it indefinitely.</p>
    <p>Poisons, bombs, and dangerous gadgets are highly restricted. When you acquire one of these items (rather than crafting it yourself), you take +2 heat.</p>
    <p>If you want to acquire an asset permanently, you can either gain it as a crew upgrade or work on it as a long-term project to set up a permanent acquisition.</p>

    <p><b>Long-term project</b></p>
    <p>When you work on a long-term project (either a brand new one, or an already existing one), describe what your character does to advance the project clock, and roll one of your attributes. Mark segments on the clock according to your result: 6-: one segment, 7-9: two segments, 10+: three segments, 13+: five segments.</p>
    <p>A long-term project can cover a wide variety of activities, like doing research into an esoteric tech, investigating a murder, establishing someone's trust, courting a new friend or contact, changing your character's fix, and so on.</p>
    <p>Based on the goal of the project, the GM will tell you the clock(s) to create and suggest a method by which you might make progress.</p>
    <p>In order to work on a project, you might first have to achieve the means to pursue it—which can be a project in itself.</p>

    <p><b>Recover</b></p>
    <p>When you recover, you seek treatment and heal your harm. You might visit a doctor who can stitch your wounds and soothe your mind with anatomical science or a masseuse who specializes in healing massages and restorative therapy. If you don't have a contact or fellow PC who can provide treatment, you can use the acquire asset activity to gain access to a healer, who can provide service for the whole crew.</p>
    <p>Recovery is like a long-term project. Your healer rolls (perhaps +Mind for a PC with a medical background or the quality level of an NPC) and then you mark a number of segments on your healing clock. 6-: one segment, 7-9: two segments, 10+, three segments, 13+: five segments.</p>
    <p>When you fill your healing clock, reduce each instance of harm on your sheet by one level, then clear the clock. If you have more segments to mark, they "roll over."</p>
    <p>You may heal yourself, but you take 2 stress when you do so. You can also choose to simply tough it out and attempt to heal without any treatment—in this case, take 1 stress and roll 2d6+0.</p>
    <p>Note that it's the recovering character that takes the recovery action. Healing someone else does not cost a downtime activity for the healer.</p>
    <p>Whenever you suffer new harm, clear any ticks on your healing clock.</p>

    <p><b>Reduce Heat</b></p>
    <p>Say what your character does to reduce the heat level of the crew and make a roll using an appropriate attriubute. Maybe you use Style to consort with your friend who's a officer and she arranges for a few incriminating reports to disappear. Or maybe you use Edge to intimidate some local citizens so they're afraid to snitch.</p>
    <p>Reduce heat according to the result: 6-: one, 7-9: two, 10+: three, 13+: five.</p>

    <p><b>Train</b></p>
    <p>When you spend time in training, mark 1 xp on your xp track. If you have the crew Training upgrade unlocked, mark +1 xp (2 total). You can train a given xp track only once per downtime.</p>

    <p><b>Get Fix</b></p>
    <p>Visit your fix trafficker to relieve stress. See <a href="#downtime/fix">Fix</a> for details.</p>
