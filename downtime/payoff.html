    <h5>Payoff</h5>
    <p>After a mission, the PCs take stock of their income from the operation. A successful mission generates both rep and cash.</p>
    <p>The crew earns 2 rep per mission by default. If the target of the mission is higher Tier than you, take +1 rep per Tier higher. If the target of the mission is lower Tier, you get -1 rep per Tier lower (minimum zero). If you keep the operation completely quiet so no one knows about it, you earn zero rep. Mark the rep on the rep tracker on the crew sheet.</p>
    <p>The crew earns cash based on the nature of the operation and/or any loot they seized:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>2 cash: A minor job; several loaded credchips.</li>
     <li>4 cash: A small job; a small safe.</li>
     <li>6 cash: A standard mission; decent loot.</li>
     <li>8 cash: A big mission; serious loot.</li>
     <li>10+ cash: A major mission; impressive loot.
    </ul>
    <p>Record the cash on the crew sheet, or divvy it up among the crew members as you see fit.</p>
    <p>Most hunting grounds have crime bosses that expect smaller crews to pay a tithe from their missions. Ask the GM if there’s a boss that you should be paying. Subtract coin equal to your crew Tier +1 when you pay a tithe to a boss or larger organization. If you’re supposed to be paying off a boss, but you don’t, start a clock for that boss’s patience running out. Tick it whenever you don’t pay. Every time it fills up, lose 1 faction status with them.</p>
    <p>You can set the scene and play out a meeting with a client or patron who’s paying the crew if there’s something interesting to explore there. If not, just gloss over it and move on to the next part of downtime.</p>
    <p>GM, definitely don’t screw around with the players when it comes to the payoff. Don’t say that the client lied and there’s no reward. Or that the meeting for the payment is actually a trap, or whatever. These types of things are staples of crime fiction, but in Terminal Glow, the PCs have enough problems coming at them from every direction already. When it comes to getting paid, just give them what they earned.</p>
