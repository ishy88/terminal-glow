    <h5>Missions</h5>
    <p>In Terminal Glow, we play to find out if a fledgling crew of characters can prosper in the underworld—and that prosperity depends upon their criminal endeavors, which we call missions.</p>
    <p>A mission is a single operation with a particular goal: burgle a suit's office, assassinate the diplomat, smuggle a piece of experimental tech into the city, etc. Usually, a mission will fall into one of three categories:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A criminal activity, determined by your crew type. An assassination, burglary, illicit vice deal, etc.</li>
     <li>Seizing a claim that you choose from your crew’s claim map. Claims help your crew grow and develop.</li>
     <li>A special mission or goal determined by the players.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A mission can be long and involved or short and sweet. There might be lots of rolls and trouble, or just a few actions to resolve it. Play to find out what happens! A mission doesn’t need to fill one session of play every time. Let it be however long it is.</p>
    <p>The PCs can set up a new mission by choosing a target (from their claims or the faction list, for example), by approaching a potential client and asking for work, or by being contacted by an NPC who needs to hire a crew for a job.</p>
    <p>A mission consists of a few key elements, detailed in this section: planning & engagement, flashbacks, and teamwork.</p>
